# Scripts
Useful scripts that maybe beneficial to the research group.

Please make sure scripts that are not for specific DFT codes are placed in the General folder with a short description of how it is used. This maybe in the form of a readme file or as comments in the script itself.

If your script is for a specific DFT code that does not have a folder please make a new folder for it.
